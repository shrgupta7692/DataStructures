Collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.

The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together.
This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value,
i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).
The base value is index 0 and the difference between the two indexes is the offset.

In Java:
Cloning of arrays

When you clone a single dimensional array, such as Object[], a “deep copy” is performed
with the new array containing copies of the original array’s elements as opposed to references.

A clone of a multi-dimensional array (like Object[][]) is a “shallow copy” however,
which is to say that it creates only a single new array with each element array a reference to
an original element array, but subarrays are shared.
